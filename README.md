📊 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Indicator dataset** available on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to evaluate global, regional, and country-specific progress. Using **SQL queries** for data extraction and **Python (Matplotlib & Seaborn)** for visualization, insights on trends, challenges, and opportunities for achieving the SDGs are derived.

## 🔎 Key Features
✅ **SQL Queries** for extracting SDG progress data (global, regional, country-specific).  
✅ **Data Visualization** using Matplotlib & Seaborn (bar charts, line charts, histograms, scatter plots).  
✅ **Comparative Analysis** on SDG indicators (poverty reduction, education access, clean energy).  
✅ **Actionable Insights & Recommendations** based on trends and disparities in SDG progress.  

## Repository Structure
📂 UN_SDG_Analysis_Project/
│── 📂 queries.sql             # SQL queries for data extraction
│── 📂 scripts/                # Python scripts for data visualization
│── README.md                  # Project overview & instructions

## 📊 SQL Queries Used
1. Tracking overall SDG progress
2. Comparing progress among different regions  
3. Analyzing yearly trends in achieving specific SDGs
4. Focusing on specific indicators like poverty reduction or education
5. Evaluating country-specific progress towards SDGs


## 📈 Data Visualization Samples
✅ **Bar Chart:** Tracks SDG progress across all 17 goals.  
✅ **Line Chart:** Yearly SDG progress comparison across different regions.  
✅ **Histogram:** Distribution of progress in poverty reduction & education access.  
✅ **Scatter Plot:** Country-wise SDG progress evaluation.

## 🏆 Key Insights from Analysis
- **Education & clean energy show the fastest progress (SDG 4, 7, 8).**
- **Poverty reduction & responsible consumption remain key challenges (SDG 1, 12).**
- **Europe leads in SDG progress, while Africa struggles with economic inequalities.**
- **Developing nations show mixed results, requiring stronger policy interventions.**

## 🚀 Recommendations for SDG Acceleration
🔹 **Expand social protection programs** to reduce poverty (SDG 1).  
🔹 **Invest in digital learning & rural education initiatives** (SDG 4).  
🔹 **Encourage renewable energy investments** (SDG 7).  
🔹 **Promote inclusive economic growth & innovation** (SDG 8 & 9).
